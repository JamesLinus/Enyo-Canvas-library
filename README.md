## Enyo Canvas Library

Canvas is a UI library for Enyo 2.

This shows how to wrap the HTML canvas element as a enyo.Control, but have
components as children of the canvas that are based on enyo.UIComponent so
they're not their own DOM nodes.

It's mainly intended as a demonstration, rather than a complete library, and
there are no features or future changes planned.
